## About Me
I am a marketer by education and have worked in this field most of the time. But over the past year or two, I have been increasingly interested in frontend development and I am studying it as much as possible.

Several things are important to me in my work:
* so that I would be interested in what I do;
* the opportunity to develop and grow in this area;
* the ability to work remotely (because I like to visit and sometimes live in different places).

I think web development is an area that satisfies all these points, and RS School is a very cool opportunity to improve my knowledge and skills in the front end, which is why I'm here.

## Skills
* HTML
* CSS / SASS / SCSS
* BEM
* Git
* Figma, Photoshop
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Editors: Sublime, VSCode, PhpStorm

## Code Example

```
function isDivideBy(number, a, b) {
    if (number % a === 0 & number % b === 0) return true;
    else return false;
}
```

## Experience
At the moment I have little experience in frontend development: I've been working as an HTML coder for about a month.
